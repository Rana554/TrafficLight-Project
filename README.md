# Smart Traffic Light System ðŸš¦

This project is a simple traffic light system built using the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller.  
All drivers (GPIO, RCC) are written manually without using HAL â€” just low-level register access.

## Features
- Custom-written low-level drivers  
- Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs for traffic control  
- Pedestrian button input  
- Delay-based timing (2s yellow, 5s red)

## Hardware Setup
- PA5 â†’ Red LED  
- PA6 â†’ Yellow LED  
- PA7 â†’ Green LED  
- PB0 â†’ Pedestrian Button
